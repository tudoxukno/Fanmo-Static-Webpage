# Fanmo Static Webpage

This is one of my favorite projects so far, and one that I plan on expanding on as time progresses. 
Fanmo was a rails app that I and my two classmates built as a project while attending Wyncode. While we didn't achieve getting the app to
work fluidly, I was able to render this static front end page as a mock-up of what the app was supposed to look like. 
Fanmo utilizes the Foursquare search API to find local venues, bars, restaurants, etc. closest to the user location. This is what the front-end portion
of Fanmo looks like.
